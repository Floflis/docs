Common for app/game developers Introduction Pretty simple: just make a Electron app/game. It is recommended to also make it support Cordova (for doing mobile releases, and for upcoming mobile version of Floflis). Note : this app/game needs to have electron as module and support npm start command. Detect platform To support Floflis' features, you can do it by simply detecting if /1 folder exists. Note : Instead, to make it more precise, detect if /1/config/dat.json exists. So, you can focus on supporting Floflis without causing confusion on other Linux OSes. Pin app/game Desktop Explore menu Taskbar Reading shared libs When building for Floflis, you can remove any asset that is already included with Floflis, which makes your app smaller for download. Libraries are in /1/Floflis/libs . Root permission will be asked when adding a library, but not when reading. Libraries FrameworkJS Bootstrap jQuery Popper.js UmbrellaJS Slick Todolist is FrameworkJS not having built-in libraries and fonts, but building it depending on target platform. Fonts Fonts (which are in web format) are stored in /1/Fonts . Included fonts: Roboto Material Icons Text Me One Cabin To read a font, just reference to its font.css file.

Where to install app's user data Put all app's user data in JSON files inside /1/config/Apps/{your-app-name} folder. Game developers Introduction You can develop games using the Floflis' built-in game engine: GDevelop. But you can use other if you prefer, althought GDevelop is the easiest. Where to install it If your game haves a install script, point it to /1/Games . Where to install game's user data Put all game's user data in JSON files inside /1/config/Games/{your-app-name} folder. .HTML5 file developers To learn more about what is a HTML5 file, click here . Just create a text file with the .html5 extension, and put its content. To add a script, add its content inside a script . To add a CSS is same as previous step, but with style tag. Do the same with images, using base64 or SVG . For .HTML5 files, it isn't a recommended practice to load external script/css. Packaging your font Floflis uses web format (woff, woff2) for fonts. Take a inspiration look at /1/Fonts folder. Each font is simply a folder containing the WOFF files and the font.css file, which looks like that: /* vietnamese */ @ font-face { font-family : Cabin ; font-style : normal ; font-weight : 400 ; font-display : swap ; src : local ( Cabin ), local ( Cabin-Regular ), url ( cabinregular-vietnamese . woff2 ) format ( woff2 ); unicode-range : U + 0102-0103 , U + 0110-0111 , U + 1EA0-1EF9 , U + 20AB ; } /* latin-ext */ @ font-face { font-family : Cabin ; font-style : normal ; font-weight : 400 ; font-display : swap ; src : local ( Cabin ), local ( Cabin-Regular ), url ( cabinregular-latinext . woff2 ) format ( woff2 ); unicode-range : U + 0100-024F , U + 0259 , U + 1E00-1EFF , U + 2020 , U + 20A0-20AB , U + 20AD-20CF , U + 2113 , U + 2C60-2C7F , U + A720-A7FF ; } /* latin */ @ font-face { font-family : Cabin ; font-style : normal ; font-weight : 400 ; font-display : swap ; src : local ( Cabin ), local ( Cabin-Regular ), url ( cabinregular-latin . woff2 ) format ( woff2 ); unicode-range : U + 0000-00FF , U + 0131 , U + 0152-0153 , U + 02BB-02BC , U + 02C6 , U + 02DA , U + 02DC , U + 2000-206F , U + 2074 , U + 20AC , U + 2122 , U + 2191 , U + 2193 , U + 2212 , U + 2215 , U + FEFF , U + FFFD ; } You can simply distribute your fonts as compressed files, althought they aren't automatically installable yet.

Floflis is Floflis. It actually is based on Debian, which depends upon Linux kernel. But it can replace anything if to be better. Actual dependence: Unix -- Linux kernel -- GNU OS/Debian -- Cinnamon Desktop Environment We are open to replace Linux to any better kernel if it exists (not because of its CoC; the new kernel should have a inclusive Code of Conduct like Linux haves). Also, Floflis is already working to replace Cinnamon DE and Debian, while keeping backwards compatiblity. Can I install common Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps on this HTML5 OS? Floflis isn't yet a HTML5 OS, but even when it becames one, you will ever have the possibility to install Linux programs on Floflis. And right now, you can install and use Linux programs. Also, there are lots of classical programs built-in and usable, such as CJDNS, Firefox, etc. Why Floflis focuses on HTML5? HTML5 apps are JavaScript apps. JavaScript is the most popular programming language, and lots of enterprises are easily porting their web apps to Electron/Cordova for keeping a unified code base. Floflis could have a kernel that is mainly in JS (for a new kind of \"BIOS\"), compiled to native language for classical devices. It makes Floflis inclusive for any kind of developer. Thought your grandma developing a new feature for a OS kernel with Eventlr? It is possible. Floflis loves Electron? Floflis is currently needing Electron, but we could also replace it to other platform that uses Gecko instead of Chromium. Is Floflis a web OS? Floflis isn't focused on web, but focuses on HTML/JavaScript. Unlike Chrome OS, Floflis thinks all apps should be offline-first, and focusing on limited/slow connections, while also working great on hi-speed 24/7 online devices. Does it relies on NPM? Most Electron apps relies on NPM packages. But Floflis' packages aren't automatically updated, and NPM will be replaced by a decentralized package manager: APM (Aragon Package Manager). Can I develop apps, games, .HTML5 files and fonts for Floflis? Yes, of course. Just head up to our Developers section . Do you have a new question?

Bellow are the layers explained: Recipe Not a working layer, but it contains references of compilers (for any supported platform) and source-codes. Recipe layer will only be available after Core layer. DNA The most lightweight layer, focused on the most weak hardware (routers, IoT, etc). Includes: Floflis CLI Installer Floflis DNA can upgrade to Floflis Core or just install need parts of it (and also from Substratum ). Core Very lightweight, can run from a intermediary router to even a Nintendo DS. Focused on IoT devices. Totally based on CLI. Includes: Directory scheme (tree, /1 folder) CJDNS + Yggdrasil NodeJS Dat protocol PRO version Floflis Core PRO, despite its name, is totally free. Floflis Core can be upgraded to its PRO version, which contains: CLI web browser (Lynx) CLI games Sounds Audio player Substratum Initially thought for Playstation 2. Contains a very basic UI (remembers Windows 1/3) that remembers a CLI, although can render some graphics. IPFS (with improvements to be lightweight) Ethereum system/APIs Aragon + APM Dillo web browser Video player with audio player IPFS and Aragon can be installed from Floflis Core or DNA . Base A lightweight desktop version, thought to run on Windows NT/95 machines and above.

Introduction Maybe you know how the Windows folders are well organized; on contrary of Linux, MacOS and Android. As root represents the complex structure of a tree, Floflis implemented the tree folder above the root. Let the root be used by nerds, and the tree for common users . The tree folder Tree is a folder named \"1\" inside the root directory. While root address is referred as / , the tree is /1 . Referring to Linux, tree is equivalent to /home folder, with write access granted to current user. But unlike on Linux, Floflis is made for personal device with a main user instead of multiple users. On newer versions Floflis will support multiple users with use of authorizations and pendrives. Why not to use /home folder instead ? Because it is a mess. Subfolders Some folders are original of tree, but others are symlinked (special shortcuts) from /home folder. Also the root is accessible from tree, in the symlinked Z-root folder. /1/Apps /1/Apps folder contains all user apps. Only HTML5 apps are added to this folder. Usually they are Electron apps. /1/AppsOld This folder contains classical apps (that aren`t in HTML5) and locally installable. Other Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps are also installable, without depending on this folder. /1/Games Contains HTML5 games. /1/Books Contains user`s books, in any format. Subfolders: /Magazines /Comics /Manuals (using MkDocs format) /Scanned /1/Orgs Contains user`s organizations. Hybridly, they are both Peeper pages and Aragon organizations. /1/3D Contains 3D things from user. This folder isn`t yet very organized, as others. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome. Subfolder: /Objects /1/Fonts Contains user`s fonts to be used on sites, slide presentations and other writings. These fonts are in web format (woff, woff2). /1/sourcecode Contains downloaded source codes user want to compile. /1/config Contains all settings that Floflis and other HTML5 apps would need. A example of contents inside dat.json : { type : config/os , url :{}, lang : en-us , title : Floflis Settings - floflis , user : floflis } /1/Floflis This is the system folder. It haves folders like the tree, except its /Resources and /libs folder. /libs folder contains shared libs from Floflis . Symlinked folders Z-root Magic folder giving access to root from tree. Desktop The same desktop displayed when you login, and as other symlinks, same from /home folder. Documents Contains a new subfolder made by Floflis: /Scanned . Images Compared to Linux it contains new subfolders: /Photos /Printscreens (a friendly meaning for non-english languages) /Drawings /Scanned /Memes /GIFs Music New subfolders: /Memes /SFX /Background /Voice Videos New subfolders: /Series /Movies /Documentaries /Animations (contains the /Animes subfolder) /Memes Downloads New subfolders: /Seeding (downloaded files you`re seeding on P2P network) Templates Simple symlink, no added subfolders.
