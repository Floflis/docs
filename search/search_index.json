Common for app/game developers Introduction Pretty simple: just make a Electron app/game. It is recommended to also make it support Cordova (for doing mobile releases, and for upcoming mobile version of Floflis). Note : this app/game needs to have electron as module and support npm start command. Detect platform To support Floflis' features, you can do it by simply detecting if /1 folder exists. Note : Instead, to make it more precise, detect if /1/config/dat.json exists. So, you can focus on supporting Floflis without causing confusion on other Linux OSes. Pin app/game Desktop Explore menu Taskbar Reading shared libs When building for Floflis, you can remove any asset that is already included with Floflis, which makes your app smaller for download. Libraries are in /1/Floflis/libs . Root permission will be asked when adding a library, but not when reading. Libraries FrameworkJS Bootstrap jQuery Popper.js UmbrellaJS Slick Todolist is FrameworkJS not having built-in libraries and fonts, but building it depending on target platform. Fonts Fonts (which are in web format) are stored in /1/Fonts . Included fonts: Roboto Material Icons Text Me One Cabin To read a font, just reference to its font.css file. Where to save user's files This guide teaches, for every kind of app/game, where to store files produced by its users. Reading app Books: /1/Books Magazines: /1/Books/Magazines Comics/novels: /1/Books/Comics MkDocs and other kinds of documentations/manuals: /1/Books/Manuals Scanned books: /1/Books/Scanned Other kind of document: {homefolder}/Documents Scanned documents: {homefolder}/Documents/Scanned 3D app This folder isn`t yet very organized, as others.

Web browsers would also ask to save .tar.gz in this folder instead of {homefolder}/Downloads folder. Imaging app Normal images/graphics are stored in {homefolder}/Pictures .

App developers Where to install it If your app haves a install script, point it to /1/Apps . Where to install app's user data Put all app's user data in JSON files inside /1/config/Apps/{your-app-name} folder. Game developers Introduction You can develop games using the Floflis' built-in game engine: GDevelop. But you can use other if you prefer, althought GDevelop is the easiest. Where to install it If your game haves a install script, point it to /1/Games . Where to install game's user data Put all game's user data in JSON files inside /1/config/Games/{your-app-name} folder. .HTML5 file developers To learn more about what is a HTML5 file, click here . Just create a text file with the .html5 extension, and put its content. To add a script, add its content inside a script . To add a CSS is same as previous step, but with style tag. Do the same with images, using base64 or SVG . For .HTML5 files, it isn't a recommended practice to load external script/css. Packaging your font Floflis uses web format (woff, woff2) for fonts. Take a inspiration look at /1/Fonts folder. Each font is simply a folder containing the WOFF files and the font.css file, which looks like that: /* vietnamese */ @ font-face { font-family : Cabin ; font-style : normal ; font-weight : 400 ; font-display : swap ; src : local ( Cabin ), local ( Cabin-Regular ), url ( cabinregular-vietnamese . woff2 ) format ( woff2 ); unicode-range : U + 0102-0103 , U + 0110-0111 , U + 1EA0-1EF9 , U + 20AB ; } /* latin-ext */ @ font-face { font-family : Cabin ; font-style : normal ; font-weight : 400 ; font-display : swap ; src : local ( Cabin ), local ( Cabin-Regular ), url ( cabinregular-latinext . woff2 ) format ( woff2 ); unicode-range : U + 0100-024F , U + 0259 , U + 1E00-1EFF , U + 2020 , U + 20A0-20AB , U + 20AD-20CF , U + 2113 , U + 2C60-2C7F , U + A720-A7FF ; } /* latin */ @ font-face { font-family : Cabin ; font-style : normal ; font-weight : 400 ; font-display : swap ; src : local ( Cabin ), local ( Cabin-Regular ), url ( cabinregular-latin . woff2 ) format ( woff2 ); unicode-range : U + 0000-00FF , U + 0131 , U + 0152-0153 , U + 02BB-02BC , U + 02C6 , U + 02DA , U + 02DC , U + 2000-206F , U + 2074 , U + 20AC , U + 2122 , U + 2191 , U + 2193 , U + 2212 , U + 2215 , U + FEFF , U + FFFD ; } You can simply distribute your fonts as compressed files, althought they aren't automatically installable yet.

Floflis is Floflis. It actually is based on Debian, which depends upon Linux kernel. But it can replace anything if to be better. Actual dependence: Unix -- Linux kernel -- GNU OS/Debian -- Cinnamon Desktop Environment -- Floflis system We are open to replace Linux to any better kernel if it exists (not because of its CoC; the new kernel should have a inclusive Code of Conduct like Linux haves). Also, Floflis is already working to replace Cinnamon DE and Debian, while keeping backwards compatiblity. Can I install common Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps on this HTML5 OS? Floflis isn`t yet a HTML5 OS, but even when it becames one, you will ever have the possibility to install Linux programs on Floflis. And right now, you can install and use Linux programs. Also, there are lots of classical programs built-in and usable, such as CJDNS, Firefox, etc. Why Floflis focuses on HTML5? HTML5 apps are JavaScript apps. JavaScript is the most popular programming language, and lots of enterprises are easily porting their web apps to Electron/Cordova for keeping a unified code base. Floflis could have a kernel that is mainly in JS (for a new kind of \"BIOS\"), compiled to native language for classical devices. It makes Floflis inclusive for any kind of developer. Thought your grandma developing a new feature for a OS kernel with Eventlr? It is possible. Floflis loves Electron? Floflis is currently needing Electron, but we could also replace it to other platform that uses Gecko instead of Chromium. Is Floflis a web OS? Floflis isn't focused on web, but focuses on HTML/JavaScript. Unlike Chrome OS, Floflis thinks all apps should be offline-first, and focusing on limited/slow connections, while also working great on hi-speed 24/7 online devices. Does it relies on NPM? Most Electron apps relies on NPM packages. But Floflis' packages aren't automatically updated, and NPM will be replaced by a decentralized package manager: APM (Aragon Package Manager). Can I develop apps, games, .HTML5 files and fonts for Floflis? Yes, of course. Just head up to our Developers section . Do you have a new question?
