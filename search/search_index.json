Floflis is Floflis. It actually is based on Debian, which depends upon Linux kernel. But it can replace anything if to be better. Actual dependence: Unix -- Linux kernel -- GNU OS/Debian -- Cinnamon Desktop Environment -- Floflis system We are open to replace Linux to any better kernel if it exists (not because of its CoC; the new kernel should have a inclusive Code of Conduct like Linux haves). Also, Floflis is already working to replace Cinnamon DE and Debian, while keeping backwards compatiblity. Can I install common Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps on this HTML5 OS? Floflis isn`t yet a HTML5 OS, but even when it becames one, you will ever have the possibility to install Linux programs on Floflis. And right now, you can install and use Linux programs. Also, there are lots of classical programs built-in and usable, such as CJDNS, Firefox, etc. Why Floflis focuses on HTML5? HTML5 apps are JavaScript apps. JavaScript is the most popular programming language, and lots of enterprises are easily porting their web apps to Electron/Cordova for keeping a unified code base. Floflis could have a kernel that is mainly in JS (for a new kind of \"BIOS\"), compiled to native language for classical devices. It makes Floflis inclusive for any kind of developer. Thought your grandma developing a new feature for a OS kernel with Eventlr? It is possible. Floflis loves Electron? Floflis is currently needing Electron, but we could also replace it to other platform that uses Gecko instead of Chromium. Is Floflis a web OS? Floflis isn't focused on web, but focuses on HTML/JavaScript. Unlike Chrome OS, Floflis thinks all apps should be offline-first, and focusing on limited/slow connections, while also working great on hi-speed 24/7 online devices. Does it relies on NPM? Most Electron apps relies on NPM packages. But Floflis' packages aren't automatically updated, and NPM will be replaced by a decentralized package manager: APM (Aragon Package Manager). Do you have a new question? You're welcome to ask it or suggest improvements, in our GitHub repo .","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#floflis-is-linux","text":"Floflis is Floflis.

As root represents the complex structure of a tree, Floflis implemented the tree folder above the root. Let the root be used by nerds, and the tree for common users . The tree folder Tree is a folder named \"1\" inside the root directory. While root address is referred as / , the tree is /1 . Referring to Linux, tree is equivalent to /home folder, with write access granted to current user. But unlike on Linux, Floflis is made for personal device with a main user instead of multiple users. On newer versions Floflis will support multiple users with use of authorizations and pendrives. Why not to use /home folder instead ? Because it is a mess. Subfolders Some folders are original of tree, but others are symlinked (special shortcuts) from /home folder. Also the root is accessible from tree, in the symlinked Z-root folder. /1/Apps /1/Apps folder contains all user apps. Only HTML5 apps are added to this folder. Usually they are Electron apps. /1/AppsOld This folder contains classical apps (that aren`t in HTML5) and locally installable. Other Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps are also installable, without depending on this folder. /1/Games Contains HTML5 games. /1/Books Contains user`s books, in any format. Subfolders: /Magazines /Comics /Documentations (using MkDocs format) /Scanned /1/Orgs Contains user`s organizations. Hybridly, they are both Peeper pages and Aragon organizations. /1/3D Contains 3D things from user. This folder isn`t yet very organized, as others. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome. Subfolder: /Objects /1/Fonts Contains user`s fonts to be used on sites, slide presentations and other writings. /1/sourcecode Contains downloaded source codes user want to compile. /1/config Contains all settings that Floflis and other HTML5 apps would need.
