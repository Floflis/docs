Introduction \u00b6 Maybe you know how the Windows folders are easily organized; on contrary of Linux, MacOS and Android. Its the small details - that some devs thinks as \"insignificant\" - what makes an OS pleasant to the normie users. As root represents the complex, low-level structure of a tree: Floflis have implemented the tree folder above the root. Let the root be used by nerds, and the tree for normal users . The tree folder \u00b6 Tree is a folder named \"1\" inside the root directory. While root address is referred as / , the tree is /1 . Outdated information --> Referring to Linux, tree is equivalent to /home folder, with write access granted to current user. But unlike on Linux, Floflis is made for personal device with a main user instead of multiple users. On newer versions Floflis will support multiple users with use of authorizations and external drives. <-- Outdated information Subfolders \u00b6 Outdated information --> Some folders are original of tree, but others are symlinked (special shortcuts) from /home folder. <-- Outdated information Also the root is accessible from tree, in the symlinked Z-root folder. <<<<<<< HEAD /1/apps (Draft, outdated) \u00b6 ======= /1/apps \u00b6 00eaafe8877adeef389e7acd16a565c6bb54398b /1/Apps folder contains all user apps ( .apps extension).
